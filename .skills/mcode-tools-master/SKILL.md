  You must load this skill before running any `mcode-tools` Bash command. The `mcode-tools` CLI is
  available on PATH and serves two purposes: (1) multimodal generation and understanding, including
  images/photos, video, audio, music, and documents; (2) discovering, inspecting, and calling all
  App/Connector tools (App = Connector), including ordinary connected App requests, scripts, and
  batch automation. For multimodal generation or understanding requests, load this skill and use
  mcode-tools through Bash. App tools are not injected into the model tool list. Ordinary MCP and
  Plugin-owned MCP tools already in the model tool list can still be called directly.
  Load this skill when the user asks to use a named App/service, or specialized external or
  connected-account data may require App discovery before general web search.

# mcode-tools Master

App = Connector: both names refer to the same connected integration. An App in the product UI is a
Connector in the CLI; use `mcode-tools connector` to discover and call its tools.

Use the `mcode-tools connector` subcommands through the `bash` tool. The launcher is already on the
current runtime process PATH when this skill is available.

For every multimodal generation or understanding request, search Connector tools before saying the
capability is unavailable. Useful discovery keywords include `image`, `photo`, `video`, `audio`,
`music`, `document`, `generate`, `understand`, and `analyze`.

Use this skill for every App/Connector request, including an ordinary single call. The absence of
App schemas from the model tool list does not mean the user has no connected Apps. Ordinary MCP and
Plugin-owned MCP tools in that list remain directly callable.

Use the available Bash and Skill permissions. If Bash, this Skill, or the CLI is unavailable, report
that App access is unavailable in this Agent; do not assume an inline fallback or bypass
restrictions.

## When to Discover App Tools

- If the user asks to use a named App/service, including a natural-language name without `@`,
  discover its tools before substituting `web_search` or a browser. A request to use a named
  integration should be fulfilled through that integration; searching the web for its name and
  the task does not satisfy that source choice. A question about the service itself is not a
  request to use it.
- For company records, legal cases, financial datasets, workspace documents, or other tasks requiring
  specialized external or connected-account data, look for a suitable App when no relevant dedicated
  tool is already known. App tools invoked through Bash count as dedicated tools. Ordinary knowledge
  questions, local-file tasks, and explicitly requested web searches do not require this discovery.
- A Plugin can bundle Apps, MCP tools, and Skills. An App can also be connected independently of a
  Plugin. Neither a missing Plugin declaration nor an empty direct tool list proves an App is absent.
- Start with the requested service name or the task capability as a discovery keyword. Names may
  use another language or spelling: if the filtered list has no match, broaden the keyword or run
  `mcode-tools connector tools` without a filter once before deciding there is no suitable tool. Never
  guess a provider identifier or tool name from the user's wording; use the returned catalog.
- Prefer a suitable App tool when available. Web search may supplement it or be a clearly identified
  fallback consistent with the user request. If a specifically requested App is unavailable or
  discovery fails, explain that limitation; do not silently present web results as App results.
  A partial catalog or error does not prove the user has not connected the App. Do not request a new
  connection merely because a keyword search missed it.
- Do not rediscover all Apps on every turn. Reuse a known suitable tool and its inspected schema when
  appropriate; each CLI command still checks the current remote catalog.

## Get a Drive Asset URL

When you have a Matrix Drive `node_id` and need a fresh download URL, use the top-level command:

```bash
mcode-tools get_asset_url <node_id>
# Equivalent kebab-case spelling:
mcode-tools get-asset-url <node_id>
```

The command returns JSON such as:

```json
{
  "node_id": "429422773780544",
  "download_url": "https://example.invalid/short-lived-url"
}
```

Unless the user explicitly instructs otherwise, download the asset directly into the current working
directory instead of only returning the `download_url`, then report the saved local path to the
user.

## Upload a Local File

Upload a local file and get a temporary URL with the top-level command:

```bash
mcode-tools upload_temp_url <file_path>
# Equivalent kebab-case spelling:
mcode-tools upload-temp-url <file_path>
# Optional MIME type override:
mcode-tools upload-temp-url <file_path> --mime-type <type>
```

Use the returned `temp_url`.

## Bash Tool Timeout

For generation commands—such as image, video, audio, music, or document generation—invoke `bash`
with `timeout: 600` (10 minutes). In the Bash tool input, `command` and `timeout` are sibling
fields:

```json
{
  "command": "mcode-tools connector call <tool_name> --args-file <path>",
  "timeout": 600
}
```

`timeout` is a top-level `bash` tool input field outside the command string. Never put `--timeout`,
`timeout=600`, or any other timeout argument in the command string: `mcode-tools connector call` has
no timeout option. Discovery and schema inspection commands can use the normal Bash timeout.

## Workflow

1. Discover candidate tools. Start with a keyword for a focused request; list all tools when the task
   is broad or filtered discovery cannot identify the requested App:

   ```bash
   mcode-tools connector tools
   mcode-tools connector tools --keyword <text>
   ```

   Do not run `mcode-tools list` or `mcode-tools connector list`; those are not valid discovery
   commands.

2. Inspect the selected tool before calling it. Use the returned `input_schema` to construct the
   arguments and `output_schema` to interpret a successful result; never guess field names or types:

   ```bash
   mcode-tools connector tool <tool_name>
   ```

3. Call the tool with exactly one JSON object. Use inline JSON for small arguments and a file for
   complex, generated, or cross-platform arguments:

   ```bash
   mcode-tools connector call <tool_name> --args '{"key":"value"}'
   mcode-tools connector call <tool_name> --args-file <path>
   mcode-tools connector call <tool_name> --args-file -
   ```

   `--args` and `--args-file` are mutually exclusive. Omitting both sends `{}`. Arrays, scalars, and
   `null` are not valid top-level arguments.

4. A successful `mcode-tools connector call` directly writes the top-level JSON value described by
   the inspected `output_schema` to stdout. Parse that value and return the useful output. Do not
   look for or unwrap `content` or `structuredContent` unless the `output_schema` declares those
   fields. If the command exits non-zero, surface its error code and message. Do not silently switch
   tools or repeatedly retry authentication errors.

## Selection Rules

- Tool names are returned as `tool_name`; pass that exact value to `tool` and `call`.
- Prefer `--keyword` before scanning a large tool catalog. It searches names and descriptions.
- Inspect `input_schema` again when validation fails instead of inventing extra arguments.
- Prefer `--args-file` when shell quoting would be fragile, especially on Windows.

## Current Availability and Failures

- Each `tools`, `tool`, and `call` command requests the current remote catalog. Known tools with
  already inspected arguments may be called again directly; no separate full list is required.
- Names in the form `connector__<provider>__<tool>` are CLI arguments, not direct model tool names.
- `partial` or `provider_failures` means discovery was incomplete. Do not claim that missing tools
  prove the user has not connected an App. Explain the failure and retry discovery when appropriate.
- A past schema does not grant access after disconnect or credential changes. Treat the current
  CLI/server response as authoritative; do not repeatedly retry authentication failures.
